## Dependency Installation (CocoaPods)

Before you can build the XCode project, you must first properly install the CocoaPod dependencies to the project.  To install these dependencies, navigate to the base directory of the project and run the following commands:

```sh
$ pod install
$ pod update
```

If you do not have CocoaPods currently on you machine, run the following command to install it:

```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Once the all of the dependencies are installed and updated, you can now open the project in XCode.  After launching XCode, open the project using the **.xcworkspace** file.

Do a Clean Build

Now you can compile the project and launch the app on the device of your choosing.
